    "\n",
    "#### üìò **Theory + Explanation**\n",
    "- Use **Markdown cells** to write detailed explanations.\n",
    "- Include headings, bullet points, blockquotes, and LaTeX math (`$...$`, `$$...$$`).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üßÆ **Math**\n",
    "- Write equations using **LaTeX syntax**: integrals, matrices, summations, etc.\n",
    "- Display both inline and block math.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üíª **Code**\n",
    "- Add **code cells** with executable code (Python, R, Julia, etc.).\n",
    "- Use output cells to display results, plots, and errors.\n",
    "- Great for combining **concept + implementation + result** all in one.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üìä **Visuals**\n",
    "- Embed plots (e.g., with `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `plotly`)\n",
    "- Include images using Markdown or HTML.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üì¶ **Modular Structure**\n",
    "- Use section headers (`#`, `##`, `###`) to create a structured document.\n",
    "- Add tables of contents with extensions (`nbextensions` or JupyterLab features).\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîÑ Bonus Features:\n",
    "- **Export to PDF/HTML** using `nbconvert`\n",
    "- **Version control** with Git (especially when paired with tools like `nbdime`)\n",
    "- **Interactive elements** with `ipywidgets`\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ö†Ô∏è Small Caveats:\n",
    "- Notebooks can get **heavy** if overloaded with large outputs or images.\n",
    "- Formatting isn't as strict or typeset-perfect as LaTeX/PDF, but still excellent for most technical purposes.\n",
    "- For publications, you might still want to **export to LaTeX or clean PDF** using `nbconvert`.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚úÖ In Summary:\n",
    "You can definitely use `.ipynb` notebooks as **complete, self-contained technical documents** ‚Äî great for learning, teaching, documenting, or even building ebooks or interactive tutorials.\n",

    "\n",
    "Yes, you **can include C++ and Java in a Jupyter Notebook**, but **not natively** like Python. Jupyter is built for interactive computing, and while Python is the default, other languages like C++ and Java can be used via **custom kernels**.\n",

    "### ‚úÖ **How to Use C++ or Java in `.ipynb`:**\n",

    "- Install the **xeus-cling kernel** (based on Clang/LLVM).\n",
    "- Provides an interactive C++ kernel for Jupyter.\n",
    "- Supports C++11, C++14, and C++17.\n",

    "Now you'll see a new kernel option like **C++17** in the notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üîπ 2. **Using Java:**\n",
    "- Use the **IJava kernel**, a Java kernel for Jupyter.\n",
    "- Allows writing and running Java code interactively.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Install steps:**\n",
    "```bash\n",
    "# Install using conda or download the jar from IJava GitHub\n",
    "git clone https://github.com/SpencerPark/IJava.git\n",
    "cd IJava\n",

    "### üß© Alternative (lightweight) Options:\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "But this is **not executable**, just for display.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### üî∏ Use `%%script` magic (in Python Kernel)\n",
    "Jupyter with the Python kernel can run shell scripts like:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "%%script bash\n",
    "g++ hello.cpp -o hello\n",
